# [Optional] Vagrant

### Tasks
## 0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
You will need Git for this project, you might have to [install it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer if it’s not done yet.

   + Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits. [Tips](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

On [GitHub.com](www.github.com):

   * Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it’s not done yet)
       - Description: **This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer**
       - Public repo: **zero_day**
       - No **README**, **.gitignore**, or license

On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:
   + Navigate to your home directory. [Tips](https://linuxconfig.org/single-linux-command-to-return-to-home-directory)
   + Create a directory **zero_day**. [Tips](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting)
   + Navigate to this new directory. [Tips](https://askubuntu.com/questions/232442/how-do-i-navigate-between-directories-in-terminal)
   + Initialize git and add the remote origin
   + Create a file **README.md** with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small [Markdown](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/) text to present this project. *This file is mandatory in projects*
   + Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server/
     origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
Good job!

You pushed your first file in your *first repository* of the *first task* of your *first School project*
